# Dataiku-Learning-Portal

As a certified Dataiku Developer and MLOPs Practitioner, this GitHub learning portal aims to maintain the documentation, ebooks, visualizations, code examples and best practice techniques that I've acquired over the years while continuing my knowledge and in-depth understanding within the Dataiku application. I utilize dataiku regularly for building robust engineering and architectural solutions to support various teams, monitor machine learning and data pipelines and for mentoring others within the application. 

The knowledge stored within this learning portal was obtained from various sources listed below:
1. Participating in Dataiku community oriented workshops/user group sessions 
2. Attending Dataiku conferences, webinars and local events: https://events.dataiku.com/everyday-ai-conference-new-york
3. Reading a host of Dataiku Ebooks provided from the vendors website: https://www.dataiku.com/stories/ebooks/
4. Completing dozens of Dataiku Academy courses: https://academy.dataiku.com/
5. Lastly, from actively working and building automated pipelines within the application and learning from exploration and trial and error to develop my best practices and tips for working within Dataiku
